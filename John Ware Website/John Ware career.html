John Ware is technically a legend farm worker in the Western Canada regions. Praised because his history, but not only that his mastery of training horses, and ranch work. Claimed a horsemanship, because he was like a horse whisperer in some sense. He was amazing at training horses, and agriculture.Following the American Civil War, Ware drifted to Texas where he learned the basics of ranch work and horsemanship. It soon became apparent that he was born to be in the saddle and, in 1882, he hired on to a cattle drive and helped bring 3000 head of cattle from the US to what would eventually become the Bar U Ranch in Southern Alberta. When the drive was over, the manager of the ranch was told that he would be a fool if he didn’t offer John Ware a job. Ware worked at the Quorn and Bar U Ranches and by 1890 he had his own spread: the "Four Nines".</p>
